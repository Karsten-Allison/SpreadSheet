# SpreadSheet

I developed a spreadsheet application using C# .Net Framework for a coursework project. 

One of the notable features of the spreadsheet was the ability to evaluate mathematical expressions entered into individual cells. This was accomplished by utilizing an expression tree, which was generated by transforming the expressions to infix notation using a shunting yard algorithm. Additionally, cells that contained either mathematical expressions or numerical values could also be utilized as variables.

Furthermore, modifications made to cells, such as alterations in color or text, are treated as commands, and recorded in either an undo or redo stack. This allows the user the ability to reverse any undesired changes made.
